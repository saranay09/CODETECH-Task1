 OVERVIEW OF PROJECT:
 PROJECT TITLE:SIMPLE CALCULATOR
Create a Python program that acts as a basic calculator. It should prompt the user to
enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division). Then, it should perform the selected operation and display the result to the
user.
Define Functions:

Four functions add, subtract, multiply, and divide perform the basic arithmetic operations. The divide function includes a check for division by zero.
Main Function:

Greets the user.
Prompts the user to enter two numbers. It uses a try block to handle any potential ValueError if the user inputs non-numerical values.
Lists available operations and prompts the user to choose one.
Based on the chosen operation, it calls the appropriate function and displays the result.
Error Handling:

Handles invalid numeric inputs and division by zero gracefully.
You can copy and run this program in any Python environment. It will interactively guide the user through performing basic calculations.
